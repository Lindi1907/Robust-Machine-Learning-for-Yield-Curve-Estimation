# Robust-Machine-Learning-for-Yield-Curve-Estimation
This is a research moduel for Msc. Economics study in University of Bonn

It is done by Lindi Li and [Gewei Cao](https://github.com/yudingshechu/Robust-Machine-Learning-for-Yield-Curve-Estimation)

Our project studys about paper _Stripping the Discount Curve—a Robust Machine Learning Approach_ written by Damir Filipovi´c Markus Pelger Ye Ye (2022)

In this paper, authors used RKHS to estimate discount curve and yield curve. Meanwhile, they also used Gaussian Process to perform inferences. 

We used [sample code provided by authors](https://github.com/yye9701/KR_example) to speed up our project, but we have add unique multiple contents by ourselves.
